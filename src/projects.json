I have done freelance work in the past building out WordPress / WooCommerce websites for small businesses, so it was a platform I was familiar with. But I had never built a custom theme completely from scratch.</p><p>Without time or cost restraints I wanted to build a WordPress site that was lightweight and fast. Using previous experience with Unix servers I set up a droplet on DigitalOcean and configured NGINX to serve pages as fast as possible. I built out a lightweight WordPress theme from the ground up using the least amount of plugins I could and staying away from large CSS, JavaScript, and image files as much as I could.</p><p>It was the fastest website I had ever built receiving a mobile score of 71 and desktop score of 95 from Google PageSpeed Insights.</p><p>I now maintain the site and social media account as hobbies. And use them as creative outlets to design graphic t-shirts.</p>",
