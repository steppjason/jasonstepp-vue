		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>My name is Jason Stepp. I am a developer that likes to learn, create, and build things.</p>
		<p>My interest in computers started as young as I can remember. Mostly fueled by my interest 
		in video games. Which lead me into the world of programming. Something which I pursue both 
		professionally as well as personally.</p>
		<p>Since then I have been learning and exploring all areas that allowed me to create things 
		with computers. Including video games, animation, 3D modeling, websites, and software. Naturally, 
		I pursued those same interests through college and my career.</p>
		<p>I love to learn new things and I am always interested in new technologies and skills.</p>
